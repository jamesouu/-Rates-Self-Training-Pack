# 📘 Rates Self-Training Pack

A self-directed learning program to replicate the **sell-side rates training** structure, inspired by J.P. Morgan’s organizational blueprint.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build practical knowledge and hands-on projects across the main **Rates trading divisions**:
- Linear Rates (Govies, Swaps, Curve trades, Spreads)
- Rates Options (Vanilla + Exotics, Vol surface, Greeks)
- Repo & Financing (Collateral, GC vs Specialness, Liquidity)
- XVA & Valuation Adjustments (CVA, FVA, MVA)
- Crossovers (FX Derivatives, Credit, Structured Products)

The goal: **shorten the learning curve** and demonstrate hedge-fund level rates expertise.

## ✅ Next Step

Start with **Week 01 — Bond Pricer**, then progress through the roadmap.  
Each project should be **documented on GitHub** with clean code, visuals, and explanations.

This README is the anchor file for your **Rates Self-Training Pack**.
