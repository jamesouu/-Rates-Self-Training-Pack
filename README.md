ðŸ“˜ Rates Self-Training Pack

A 12-Week Project-Based Journey into Sell-Side Rates Trading

â¸»

ðŸ”Ž Overview

This repository is a structured 12-week self-training program designed to replicate the learning curve of a junior sell-side rates trader at a top investment bank (e.g., J.P. Morgan).

The repo contains mini-projects, Python notebooks, and research notes covering the core building blocks of a modern rates desk:
	â€¢	Linear Rates (Govies, swaps, inflation, spreads)
	â€¢	Rates Options (Swaptions, vol surface, exotics)
	â€¢	Financing (Repo, STIR, basis)
	â€¢	XVA & Inventory Management (capital, valuation adjustments)
	â€¢	Quants & Strats (models, coding, risk tools)

Each project is designed to be hands-on, client-desk relevant, and GitHub/PM-friendly â€” showing not just theory, but practical applications in markets.
